            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

To Teach us this Evangelical and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <hi>Mystery,</hi> there was, <hi>A Sacrifice for the whole Congregation,</hi> preſcribed in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Paedagogy.

Truly, The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has been pleaded for <hi>Boſton,</hi> and, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſay, <hi>Therefore</hi> it is, that the Town is not made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the Vengeance of God. God ſent <hi>Help</hi> to the Town, that was the very <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the Land, that He had a pitty for: But why ſo? He ſaid, in Iſa. 37.35. <hi>I will defend this Town, to Save it, for my Servant Davids ſake.</hi> Has this Town been <hi>Defended?</hi> It has been for the ſake of the <hi>Beloved</hi> JESUS; Therefore has the Daughter of <hi>Boſton</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>her Head</hi> at you, O ye Calamities, that have been Impending over <hi>her Head.</hi> O <hi>Helped,</hi> and Happy Town!

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; Let the Lord be in a ſpecial manner <hi>Glorified,</hi> for the Miniſtry of His Good <hi>Angels,</hi> in that <hi>Help</hi> that has been miniſtred unto us. A <hi>Jacob</hi> lying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is abundant cauſe to think, That every Town in which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is worſhipped, hath an <hi>Angel</hi> to watch over it. The Primitive Chriſtians,

Why have not the <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> broke in upon us, to prey upon us, with ſore <hi>Deſtruction?</hi> 'Tis becauſe we have had, <hi>A Wall of Fire</hi> about us; that is to ſay, A Guard of <hi>Angels,</hi> thoſe <hi>Flames</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> have been as a <hi>Wall</hi> unto us.

            <p>What ſhall I ſay more? There is one Article of <hi>Piety</hi> more to be Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us all; and it is an Article, which all <hi>Piety</hi> does exceedingly Turn upon. That is, <hi>The Sanctification of the Lords Day.</hi> Some very Judicious Perſons, have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That as <hi>they Sanctified the Lords Day, Remiſly or Carefully, juſt ſo, their Affayrs uſually proſpered all the Enſuing Week.</hi> Sirs, You cannot more conſult the Proſperity of the Town, in all its Affayrs, than by Endeavouring that the <hi>Lords Day</hi> may be Exemplarily <hi>Sanctifyed.</hi> When People about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took too much Liberty on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the Ruler of the Town <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> with them, and ſaid, <hi>Ye bring wrath upon Iſrael by prophaning the Sabbath</hi> I fear, I fear, There are many among us, to whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Ye bring wrath upon</hi> Boſton, <hi>by prophaning the Sabbath.</hi> And what
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:191921:20"/> 
               <hi>Wrath? Ah Lord, prevent it!</hi> But there is an awful Sentence in Jer. 17.27. <hi>If ye will not Hearken unto me, to Sanctify the Sabbath-Day, then will I kindle a Fire</hi> on the Town, <hi>and it ſhall Devour, and ſhall not be Quenched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Let the <hi>Piety</hi> of the Town ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf, in a due Regard unto the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of Him, whoſe <hi>Help</hi> ha's <hi>Hitherto</hi> been a <hi>Shield</hi> unto us. Let the <hi>Ark</hi> be in the Town, and God will <hi>Bleſs</hi> the Town! I believe, it may be found, That in the <hi>Mortal Scourges</hi> of Heaven, which this Town ha's felt, there ha's been a <hi>Diſcernable Diſtinction,</hi> of thoſe that have come up to Attend all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the Communion of His <hi>Churches.</hi> Though theſe have had, as 'tis fit they ſhould, a Share, in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Deaths,</hi> yet the <hi>Deſtroying Angel,</hi> ha's not had ſo great a proportion of theſe in his Commiſſion, as he ha's had of others.

They are <hi>Gone,</hi> They are <hi>Gone</hi> into that Eternal World, whither <hi>We</hi> muſt quickly follow them. Here is another Petition, to be made unto our God; <hi>Lord, Help us to Number our Dayes, and apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom, that when the places that now know us, do know us no more, we may be gone into the City of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore; What <hi>Changes</hi> have we

And an huge <hi>Fleet</hi> of thy Veſſels, which they would make, if they were all together, that have miſcarried in the late War, ha's given thee to Read more of it.

A Renowned Writer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Pagans,</hi> could make this Remark; There was a Town, ſo Irreligious and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical, that they did not pay their <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> unto God: (which the <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> taught the Pagans to do!) and ſayes he, they were, by a Sudden Deſolation ſo

Ah, <hi>My Young Folks;</hi> There are few <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> paid unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt among you. From hence it comes to paſs, that the Conſuming Wrath of God, is every day upon you. <hi>New England</hi> ha's been like a <hi>Tott'ring Houſe;</hi> the very <hi>Foundations</hi> of it have been Shaking: But the Houſe thus over-ſetting by the <hi>Whirlwinds</hi> of the Wrath of God, hath been like <hi>Jobs</hi> Houſe; <hi>It falls upon the Young men, and they are Dead!</hi> The Diſaſters on our <hi>Young Folks</hi> have been ſo multiplied, that there are few Parents among us, but what will go with <hi>Wounded Hearts,</hi> down unto their Graves: Their dayly moans are, <hi>Ah, My Son cut off in his Youth! My Son, my Son!</hi> Behold then, the <hi>Help</hi> that we are to ask of our God; and why do we, with no more Dayes of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> with <hi>Faſting,</hi> ask it? <hi>Lord, Help the Young People of Boſton, to Remember thee in the Dayes of their Youth, and Sanctify unto the Survivers, the Terrible Things that have come upon ſo many of that Generation.</hi>

            <p>IT is Reported, as the Special and Signal Favour of God, unto His People, in Exod. 1.20, 21. <hi>The People multiplied, and He made Them</hi> [that is, <hi>the People,</hi> for the word is in the Maſculine Gender,] <hi>Houſes:</hi> Which Favour of God in the neareſt and ſtricteſt ſenſe wherein that expreſſion is commonly uſed, is not only moſt <hi>Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Vouchſafed, but almoſt <hi>Miraculouſly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:191921:26"/> unto us who now Compoſe this Aſſembly. Our Gracious God ha's given us <hi>Houſes,</hi> wherein we Enjoy the Comforts of Life, Covered and Sheltered from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Injuries; Yea, and we have the <hi>Houſes</hi> of our Gracious God alſo ſet open unto us, without the Liberties whereof, I hope, we ſhould not find our ſelves able to <hi>Taſt</hi> the Comforts of our own. Let it not be thought <hi>Unſeaſonable,</hi> I am ſure, it ſhould not be <hi>Unprofitable,</hi> for us to hear in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of God at this Time, ſome Singular Things, wherein the Welfare of our own is more than a little concerned.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Houſes,</hi> with which our God ha's favoured us, there are Two Conſiderations, which doubtleſs, every man in this Aſſembly, of his own Accord, hath Entertained.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſuppoſe, We are all ſenſible, That for us to Looſe our <hi>Houſes</hi> by any Diſaſter whatſoever, would be a very terrible Calamity; Oh! It would be a <hi>Judgment</hi> of God, wherein the <hi>Anger</hi> of God, would be ſeen written with <hi>Fiery</hi> Characters. If by an Accident, or by an Enemy, our <hi>Houſes</hi> be Laid in Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:191921:27"/> every Roar of the Raging Flames, every Crack of the Tumbling Timbers, every Downfal of the Undermined Walls, and every Jangle of the <hi>Bells</hi> then tolling the Funeral of thoſe Houſes, would loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utter that voice, in Deut. 32.22. <hi>A Fire is Kindled in the Anger of God!</hi> It were a diſmal Thing for our <hi>Houſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming too <hi>Hot</hi> for us, to ſay, <hi>Be gone; ye ſinful Inhabitants, Be gone; you ſhall never Eat, or Sleep, or Talk, or Pray, in us, any more;</hi> and for our Conſorts &amp; Children with us, to be Stript in a few Hours, of all that we have been getting for many years, and be turn'd Shiftleſs and Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>out of Doors,</hi> to Lodge <hi>Next Door</hi> unto Beggary. A Town ſo Afflicted, may have this Lamentable Account given of them, in Iſa. 42.25. <hi>The Lord hath poured on them the Fury of His Anger, and it hath ſet them on Fire round about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, And there is as much cauſe for us to be ſenſible, That it is the meer <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of our Good God, which keeps us from ſuch a Terrible Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, as the Loſs of our <hi>Houſes.</hi> How eaſy a thing were it, for the Vengeance of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:191921:27"/> Heaven, to Lay all our <hi>Houſes</hi> in Ruinous Heaps before to morrow morning! Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We may ſay, <hi>'Tis becauſe we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Help from God, that we continue to this Day.</hi> We may ſit in our Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſes, and make that Confeſſion, in Pſal. 127.1. <hi>The Lord keeps the Town; the Watchman waketh but in vain.</hi> When we think, how much Deſtruction may ariſe from one <hi>Spark,</hi> or one <hi>Snuff,</hi> and, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>How great a matter a Little Fire kindles!</hi> And when we think, how many <hi>Careleſs,</hi> how many <hi>Fooliſh,</hi> how many <hi>Drunken,</hi> yea, and how many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly <hi>Malicious</hi> perſons, perſons wicked enough, <hi>To burn their Neighbours Houſes, only that they may Roaſt their own Eggs,</hi> may creep in among us; Or when we think of him whom we may call OG, which is in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <hi>The Burner,</hi> for the Delight that he has taken in <hi>Scorching men with Fire;</hi> We may with Admiration acknowledge, <hi>'Tis our God that is our Keeper.</hi> Oh! we muſt make that Acknowledgment before the Lord, in Pſal. 121.4. <hi>Behold, He that keepeth Iſrael, doth neither Slumber nor Sleep;</hi> Elſe we ſhould be wak'd out of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:191921:28"/> our next <hi>Sleep,</hi> with a Formidable <hi>Outcry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Senſible of theſe Things, we ſhall not count it Improper, to beſtow a brief Diſcourſe, upon the <hi>Methods,</hi> which we are, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to take for the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Preſervation of our <hi>Houſes;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, now the Seaſon of the year advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein there are the moſt pungent Invitations, for ſuch <hi>Methods</hi> to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Behold then the Great Method, for the ſecure Enjoyment of our <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> which the Oracles of God have directed us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: It is, <hi>The putting away Iniquity far from our Tabernacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Upright</hi> man, <hi>Job,</hi> had this among the Heavy Trials befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him, That he Loſt his <hi>Houſe:</hi> Now under this Trial, one of his Friends gives him this Advice: That he would by <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> with God, and <hi>Repentance</hi> of Sin, Endeavour, to anſwer the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heaven concerning him. To Encourage him hereunto, here is this Bleſſing promiſed, <hi>Thou ſhalt be Built up:</hi> q. d. Thou ſhalt then have thy <hi>Houſe</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, without the fear of <hi>Looſing</hi> it any more.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:191921:28"/>
            <p>The Clauſe which falls under our more particular Notice is that; <hi>Thou ſhalt put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Iniquity, far from thy Tabernacles:</hi> which is here mentioned, as the Effect of <hi>Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Almighty.</hi> Now, by <hi>Iniquity,</hi> we may underſtand, either the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> or the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Take it for the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and then the ſenſe runs thus; <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thy Returning to the Almighty, by thy not Suffering of any Iniquity in thy Tabernacles.</hi> Take it for the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and then the ſenſe runs thus; <hi>By Returning to the Almighty thou wilt Save thy Tabernacles, from ſuch Ruines as will come upon them, if thou continue in Iniquity.</hi> Take it which way you will, there is this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in it.</p>
            <q>The Way for us to ſecure the Comfortable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of our Tabernacles, is, by Returning unto the Almighty, to put Iniquity far from our Tabernacles.</q>
            <p>There are Three plain Aſſertions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, by which I may come fairly at my Deſign, to promote <hi>Houſhold-Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> in the management of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fetch'd from the Benefit thence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, unto the very <hi>Houſes,</hi> wherein we mentain that <hi>Religion.</hi>

               <hi>I.</hi> In true <hi>Religion,</hi> men do <hi>Return unto the Almighty God.</hi> There was a Bleſſed <hi>Communion</hi> with God, which man had at his firſt <hi>Creation</hi> by God.

Alas, It was not Long, before Man turned his Back upon the <hi>Service</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of His Maker: It was not Long before Man Embraced the <hi>Vain Things</hi> of this World, inſtead of the God that made him. Every Sinner is now Guilty of that Folly, that Frenzy, that <hi>Horrible Thing,</hi> in Jer. 2.13. <hi>He hath forſaken the Fountain of Living Waters, and he hath hew d him out Broken Ciſterns.</hi> Well, but now in <hi>Religion,</hi> there is a <hi>Converſion</hi> and a <hi>Returning</hi> of the Sinner; he ſaies, <hi>I will Return to my first Object, becauſe it is beſt being with him.</hi> The Term <hi>From which</hi> a man does <hi>Return</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> is, <hi>All Sin</hi> whatſoever; and every <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> every <hi>Profit,</hi> every <hi>Honour,</hi> which the Heart is by <hi>Sin</hi> carried forth unto.

               <hi>VII.</hi> Would we comfortably Enjoy our <hi>Tabernacles?</hi> Then Let us Remember that they are no more than <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> When you go into your Comfortable <hi>Houſes,</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them no more than <hi>Stages,</hi> whereat you can only ſtay to Bait a while in your Journey, to your Eternal State. Oh! Live like <hi>Strangers</hi> in your own <hi>Houſes;</hi> and be the <hi>Houſe</hi> never ſo convenient, yet count not your ſelves at <hi>Home,</hi> in that <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you, to Lay up this Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you. If you would <hi>Keep</hi> any thing, in this World, you muſt not ſet your <hi>Hearts</hi> upon it: and indeed, it is fit that men ſhould keep nothing of this World, which they do ſet their <hi>Hearts</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:191921:41"/> upon. The way for us, to have our <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> taken away from us, is, to have our <hi>Hearts</hi> vainly fond of continuing in them. It was therefore an Annual, and a moſt ſuitable <hi>Ceremony,</hi> which the Lord Enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon His People of old; When a Good <hi>Harvest</hi> had fill'd their <hi>Houſes,</hi> God ordered them to go out of their <hi>Houſes;</hi> they muſt then go make Little <hi>Tabernacles</hi> abroad, and keep the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> Thus did the Lord mind them of their Condition in this World; when they had never ſo much of <hi>this World</hi> about them, they muſt not forget that they were no more than <hi>Sojourners</hi> in the World. This I ſay; Tho' we have <hi>Houſes</hi> that we can <hi>Feaſt</hi> in, yet Let us have the Temper of a <hi>Feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> in us. Let our <hi>Hearts</hi> be gone out of our <hi>Houſes,</hi> &amp; the Lord will give <hi>us,</hi> Leave to ſtay the Longer in them.</p>
            <p>Oh! Let us not be thoſe <hi>Fools,</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid in Pſal. 49.11. <hi>Their Inward Thought is, that their Houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their Dwelling-places to all Generations:</hi> Nor let us fooliſhly count, the <hi>Goods</hi> in our Houſes, <hi>Goods laid up for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:191921:41"/> many years.</hi> As we walk about our <hi>Houſes,</hi> let this Conſideration come into our Hearts; <hi>How eaſily can all theſe Riches take themſelves Wings and flee away! One or Two Hours, may lay this Houſe Level with the Ground.</hi> But there is a further Conſideration, which is then alſo to come into our Hearts; <hi>'Tis but a little while that I ſhall remain in this Houſe; It won't be long, before I am Lock'd up in a Coffin under Ground, when the place that now knows me, will know me no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what ſhould be the Iſſue of ſuch Conſiderations? I would Pray you, let it be <hi>This.</hi> Let us make ſure of an <hi>Houſe Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> to be Enjoy'd by us, when our <hi>Earthly Tabernacles</hi> can be no more uſeful to us. If you Enquire, <hi>How this is to be done?</hi> I anſwer, in one Word; By giving to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of Heaven, a <hi>Dwelling</hi> in our Souls. Our <hi>Houſes</hi> here, though made of <hi>Brick</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> it ſelf, they are only <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> But the Apoſtle tells us, in 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>We have an Houſe Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> The Blaſphemous <hi>Julian,</hi> would inſolently call our Lord Jeſus
